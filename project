Project Name:
Analytics Cluster (BCP) Business Countinuity Plan

Project Overview:
RIVA operates a big analytics cluster which stores various events generated by 
mobile clients, across various platforms like Android, iPhone and Windows. Events
like user installs/downloads, user call statistics, user credit recharges, app
events like various app performance metrics etc., are logged at a high frequency.
These events are stored in Hbase tables and then queried to generate actionable
intelligence on a  host of business intelligence exercises like:

1. strategize on marketing
2. better the app experience 
3. actual revenue generation

Our goal is to provide this analytics service up and running in the face of various
failures in AWS ecosystem like:

1. Machine failures.
2. Availability zone failures

Also, we envisage to have zero data loss ideally. 
   
Project Description:

The goal described in the Project Overview will be achieved by tasks listed below:

1. a system to start an AWS EMR cluster, which will be proportionate to the amount 
   of data stored in main production cluster

2. Logic to check when cluster is fully initialized and ready to accept data backups

3. A system for full and differential backups, the schedule will be:
   a. a regular backup which will be done at the start 
   b. differential backups, on a daily basis, after that initial full backup is
      done.

4. An option to trigger full backups manually.

5. A system to check where the data that we are backing up is reliable and has integrity
   We can have a hbase python client to query the last 1000 records and check if
   data integrity is ok

6. Make the main production HA by adding a backup namenode, to prevent namenode
   failures.

7. Make the developers add an additional endpoint (for main production cluster 
   and also the EMR cluster endpoint)

Technologies used:
1. python (2.6/7.x)
2. AWS EC2/EMR (aws python client library, boto)
3. Linux
4. HBase python client
